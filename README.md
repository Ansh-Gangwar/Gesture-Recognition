# Real-Time Numerical Hand Gesture Classification using Edge Impulse
In this project, I collected numerical hand gesture data using a phone camera in diverse conditions including varying light and background, trained the model with Edge Impulse, and successfully deployed it for real-time live classification through the phone's camera.
