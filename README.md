# Real-Time Numerical Hand Gesture Classification using Edge Impulse
In this project, I collected numerical hand gesture data using a phone camera in diverse conditions including varying light and background, trained the model with Edge Impulse, and successfully deployed it for real-time live classification through the phone's camera.

# Illustration of Live Classification
The subsequent demonstration provides a recorded illustration of live image classification that has been executed on a smartphone camera. The camera is utilized to capture live images, following which the CNN model predicts the class of the image, along with its corresponding inference time.
